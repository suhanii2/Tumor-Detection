# Tumor-Detection
üß† Brain Tumor Detection using CNN | Python | Deep Learning
An AI-based system that detects brain tumors from MRI scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was trained on a labeled dataset of MRI images and achieved high accuracy and precision in classification tasks. This project demonstrates end-to-end deep learning implementation including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.

üî¨ Features:
Binary classification: Tumor vs. No Tumor

Image preprocessing with OpenCV and NumPy

Trained CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras

Achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visual performance evaluation using confusion matrix and graphs

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
